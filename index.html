    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Orlando, I am currently an 8th grade English teacher at a college preparatory school and looking forward to retiring from education in June. Before teaching, I worked in advertising and event planning following my graduation from UF in 1999. I also had a home organization business for many years when I started teaching. I am familiar with learning management systems (LMS) and Adobe products; however, web development and coding are new to me.</p>

    <h2>Painting</h2>
    <p>Although hyper-organized, I also have a deep creative side and enjoy painting, photography, and visual arts. During the 2020 lockdown, I started painting again after a long hiatus. I'm constantly juggling a million projects or ideas in my head, yet I am fluid and adaptable; therefore, an octopus best represents me, as depicted in my “Red Octopus Dream” watercolor painting. The Dreamy Red Octopus is one of a series of five—others are in various states of completion:</p>

    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <p>In addition to visual arts, I enjoy writing and baking. I am currently trying new bread recipes weekly and find the scent of fresh bread baking every Sunday and a soft opening to the new week ahead. This week’s recipe is Restless Chipotle's <a href="https://www.restlesschipotle.com/amish-white-bread/"target="_blank">“No-Fail Amish White Bread”</a> orignially found on <i>Pinterest</i>:</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Travel takes me out of my comfort zones and inspires me to see, taste, and try new things. It constantly challenges me to adapt to and explore new surroundings and engage with different people, embrace adventures as they come, and share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones. My bucket list includes traveling to each state in the U.S. and each continent. As of now, I have visited 33 states (more than just driving through or for a layover) and two continents.</p>
   
    <p>Hopefully, a change in my career and the ability to work remotely will provide me with the opportunity to meet these goals successfully. <a href="https://www.travelordietrying.com/"target="_blank">Travel or Die Trying</a> has provided great resources and inspiration for domestic travel.</p>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>Working remotely and maximizing my analytical and creative skills are critical to my career goals. Working remotely during the pandemic highlighted a disbalance in my day-to-day work environment, and I am seeking a more fluid and flexible approach to working. Web design and development appealed to me for many reasons; however, I understand that I have a great deal to learn to succeed in this career.</p>
    
    <p>I am confident that I will quickly catch on and learn this new "language" of web design and development. I am interested in learning more about UX and SEO. While transitioning from the education sector to web design and development, the following are highlights of my current career goals:</p>
   
    <ol>
        <li>Work remotely with flexible scheduling.</li>
        <li>Work in an environment that maximizes my analytical and creative skills.</li>
        <li>Develop critical skills needed for successful web design and development.</li>
    </ol>
